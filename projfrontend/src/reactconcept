Talking to backend ,
 using fetch or axiom 
    (pass the url u want to visit and other information required for that route  )

i.e. iss URL ki information fetch krni h 
    after this ,
    then(if success)  and catch(if failure) block

Fragment
    just like a div ,not exactly bcoz it doesn't create blocks but keeps in same line. 

React hooks --
for individual data types --- useState
for multiple data type --- branch'
for preloading data ---useEffect

when we use call a function with paramter except string is  passed in it then use callback is necessary.
for normal function to execute no need of callback


Picking up something from the URL say parameter
    using props---better to destructure
Way 1
 so to extract parameter from url
    use match 
    
IN  case of preload in update  , the parameter has to be passed ,for that 
    so match .param.parameter
