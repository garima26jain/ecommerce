    using s3 bucket
     i.e. a folder  on the local machine & just store the path & whenever u need the image
     just serve the path
This approach is common for all mp3 ,videos ,firebase 

when we use get request ,mp3 ,photos are not directly served as they are bulky to get from the db
so just hide it by 
            declaring it undefined.

sort([["queryString",orderofsorting(asc,desc)]])
eg=  Product.find().sort([['updatedAt','desc']])


updation of more than 1 in mongoose---like stock & sold habe to be updated
    method--model.bulkWrite()
        3 parameters-ops(operation that has to be performed)--like insertOne,deleteOne,insertMany,UpdateOne etc,
                     options--query etc
                     callback

        to use options ,,we find to find it first,,,thru filter{key:value}
                                                         then options


Enums --to restrict choices

i.e. only a few options are available.

eg-status of booking-booking state,confirmed state, shippping ,cancelled state
