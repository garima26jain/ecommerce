1.create a schema

var schema_Name= new mongoose.Schema({
    user defined fields
},system defined fields)


Now we need to create a schema, and a model for that schema. 
We do this by creating a new mongoose schema and defining the parameters.
 Once we have a schema we assign a mongoose model to that schema.


how to decide if schema should be defined or not
    we have product schema  and order schema 
    but the product schema is generally defined for one prodct  & 
    if the customers purchases more than 1 quantity then that needs to be specified as well,
    originally they r associated with the schema product
         so this requires a new Schema say ProductCartSchema
    
//exporting multiple schema
const Order=mongoose.model("Order",OrderSchema);
const ProductCart=mongoose.model("ProductCart",Product);

module.exports={Order,ProductCart};

defining multiple schema in a single field
--not a good idea though 

here order --- user schema,category schema,productschema,order schema
2.export it using 
    module.exports=mongoose.model("name",createdSchema)
3.virtual -fields that are created on go or computed from the information given by user
4.{timestamps:true}---means that whenever new insertion is done ,it records the exact time and stores in db
---it can also be useful for filtering on the basis of creation time 


one schema linked with another schema-->populate method is used

eg- product  have some cateogory i.e.apparel have summer,winter ,classic category etc.
i.e. here product schema is linked with category schema 

    for this we have populate method


child Schema 
Parent Schema:which is coming from other schema
    for this, use destructuring in the schema 
       eg-   const {ObjectId}=mongoose.Schema;

    later give reference as one of the property of the field i.e. from where we have to pull 
        eg-     user:{
                    type:ObjectId,
                    ref:"User"
                }


 //storing the photos in database 
    if photosize is small
    photo:{
        data:Buffer,
        contentType:String
    }

    if photosize is large then 
    first store it in a folder somewhere in firebase or amazon cloud and then pull the reference



whenever db func is called ,then in callback we have 2 things passed as a parameter
    1.err
    2.object if it exists
