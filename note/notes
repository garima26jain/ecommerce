models--for db
routes--
controller--for working

if some value that is fetched from the db doesn't need to be displayed on the front end then 
    set it to undefined.

as in controllers user.js   ---salt & encrypassword are sensitive info so it need to be displayed 
    so we can do it by
    
    req.profile.salt=undefined;
    req.profile.encry_password=req.profile;


Flow
