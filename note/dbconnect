//whatever is sensitive information like key, info regarding payment gateway
 //put it inside a seperate file
 as in case of connection to db ,
 we moved the DB URL to a file called .env

connect files with db

use mongoose to connect to db
while creating a server listen to a port and using ``(backticks)
 then to use any variable defined use ${var_name}

 Here the function run is as follows-
    myfun.run().then().catch()
        then is executed if successful
        catch is executed if failed

process -where all env variables are attached

to call server  don't directly call the PORT instead use
    process.env.PORT||port_no
